  IMS Open Corpus Workbench: CWB/Perl Version 3.0.6

  compatible with CWB version 3.0.2+ and version 3.4.x


This package contains a Perl interface for the IMS Open Corpus Workbench,
as well as several utility modules and scripts.  It is highly recommended
to install the CWB/Perl package even if no direct usage from Perl is intended.


PREREQUISITES

Before compiling the CWB/Perl package, you must install an up-to-date version
of the IMS Open Corpus Workbench (see above for precise version requirements).
You can either compile the CWB from source or install a binary distribution
available from http://cwb.sourceforge.net/.

If you did not install the CWB in a standard place (i.e. in a directory in 
your search path), make sure that the "cwb-config" program can be executed
from the command line.  This will enable the CWB/Perl makefile to obtain the
necessary configuration information.


QUICK INSTALLATION GUIDE

If you have never installed a Perl module before: don't despair.  All you
have to do is to execute the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

You will probably have to login as root for the last step (or you can type
"sudo make install" and enter your root password).  If you want to install
the CWB/Perl modules in a non-standard location, say in "~/perl/lib/perl5/..."
and "~/perl/man/...", type the following instead of "perl Makefile.PL":

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/perl INSTALLMAN1DIR=~/perl/man/man1

Note that you will then have to include the appropriate subdirectories of
"~/perl/lib/perl5/" in your Perl search path in order to use the CWB modules.

If the "cwb-config" utility is not in your standard search path, you can specify
its location with the --config option:

    perl Makefile.PL --config=~/cwb-3.0/bin/cwb-config

Type e.g. "cwb-make -h" for a usage summary, and "perldoc cwb-make" for the
full manual page.
